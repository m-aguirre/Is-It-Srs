Customer Quote "I signed up and was able to immediately post what symptoms I had.  Soon after, a doctor responded that my symptoms were very common and would most likely clear up in a few days.  This was very reasuring because I had browsed webMD earlier that day and was convinced that I had cancer." 

Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
